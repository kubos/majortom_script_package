# Major Tom Script API Package
Python Package for interacting with Major Tom's Scripting API

The Scripting API functions are accessible under the `ScriptingAPI` class:

```python
from majortom_scripting import ScriptingAPI
```

Use the `help()` function to see it's capability,
and check out our [demo scripts](https://github.com/kubos/########)
